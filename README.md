### A description of your solution at a high-level:-
the project is pretty straight forward. it includes crud operations for services and orders.
while updating or creating and order, we check for existing orders created in past three hours. if found, we restrict the creation or updations.
All controllers and models extend a base class containing the common crud logic to prevent repetitive code.

### language used, framework used
node.js, postgresql, express.js
ORM - bookshelf
query builder - knex.js

### assumptions made that affected the solution 
a order can be associated with multiple services. 
every service has a different fee.
totalFee of a order will be the total of those services.

### What would change i if i built this for production
will add a jwt based authentication for users and allow user-scoped orders.
